# Weekend Harmony App - Documentation

## What This App Does

Weekend Harmony is a comprehensive weekend planning application that helps users create memorable experiences. Users can plan activities, track their mood, get AI-powered recommendations, and visualize their plans on interactive maps. The app combines intelligent suggestions with location-based features to make weekend planning effortless and enjoyable.

## Major Design Decisions

### 1. Why We Used React + TypeScript
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript prevents runtime errors and improves code reliability
- **Modern Development**: Latest React features with hooks and functional components
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable, maintainable component structure
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent tooling and debugging capabilities
- **Future-Proof**: Easy to migrate to new React features

### 2. Why We Chose Zustand for State Management
- **Lightweight**: Minimal bundle size impact compared to Redux
- **Simple API**: Easy to learn and implement
- **TypeScript Native**: Built-in TypeScript support
- **Performance**: Optimized re-renders and state updates
- **Persistence**: Built-in localStorage and IndexedDB integration

### 3. Why We Used Modern Google Maps Integration
- **Official Support**: Using @vis.gl/react-google-maps for best practices
- **Advanced Features**: Support for modern markers, clustering, and real-time location
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering and memory management
- **Mobile Ready**: Responsive design with touch gestures
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support and keyboard navigation

## How We Built Components

### Component Architecture
Our component hierarchy follows modern React patterns:

**Foundation Layer (UI Primitives)**:
- `Button` - Consistent action triggers with loading states
- `Card` - Information containers with elevation and shadows
- `Input` - Form controls with validation and accessibility
- `Modal` - Overlay components with focus management
- `LoadingSpinner` - Consistent loading indicators

**Feature Components (Business Logic)**:
- `ActivityCard` - Rich activity display with ratings and categories
- `WeekendPlanEditor` - Drag-and-drop plan creation interface
- `EmotionWidget` - Camera-based mood detection and manual input
- `ModernGoogleMap` - Interactive maps with real-time location tracking
- `ActivityMarkers` - Map markers with clustering and custom icons

**Page Components (Views)**:
- `HomePage` - Dashboard with quick actions and recent plans
- `PlanCreator` - Step-by-step plan building wizard
- `PlanHistory` - Timeline view of past plans with analytics
- `SettingsPage` - User preferences and data management

**Smart Components (State Integration)**:
- `InteractiveMap` - Map container with API key management
- `CollaborationPanel` - Real-time sharing features (deprecated)
- `AdvancedFeatures` - AI recommendations and mood analysis

### Component Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Prop Interface Design**: Clear TypeScript interfaces for all props
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling at component level
- **Performance Optimization**: useMemo and useCallback where beneficial
- **Accessibility First**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

## State Management Strategy

### Store Architecture
We use multiple specialized Zustand stores:

1. **ActivityStore** (`useActivityStore`)
   - All available activities and filtering logic
   - Search functionality and categorization
   - User favorites and activity statistics
   - Smart recommendations based on usage patterns

2. **WeekendPlanStore** (`useWeekendPlanStore`)
   - Current plan creation and editing
   - Scheduled activities and timeline management
   - Plan templates and quick actions
   - Sharing and collaboration features

3. **UserPreferencesStore** (`useUserPreferencesStore`)
   - App settings and customization
   - Theme preferences and accessibility options
   - Location permissions and map settings
   - Privacy and data management preferences

4. **EmotionStore** (`useEmotionStore`)
   - Mood tracking and emotion history
   - Camera-based emotion detection results
   - Mood-to-activity mapping algorithms
   - Emotional state analytics

### Data Persistence Strategy
- **Immediate Storage**: Critical data saved to localStorage on every change
- **Batch Sync**: Less critical data synced periodically to IndexedDB
- **Offline Queue**: Actions queued when offline, synced when connection returns
- **Data Migration**: Automatic schema updates for app version changes

### Performance Optimizations
- **Selective Subscriptions**: Components only re-render when relevant data changes
- **Memoized Selectors**: Expensive computations cached until dependencies change
- **Lazy Loading**: Store data loaded on-demand to reduce initial bundle size
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of old data and unused subscriptions

## UI Polish and User Experience

### Design Principles
1. **Keep it simple**: Not too many buttons or options
2. **Make it pretty**: Nice colors and smooth animations
3. **Easy to use**: Clear labels and helpful hints
4. **Works on phones**: Looks good on any screen size

### Visual Design
- **Clean layout**: Lots of white space, not crowded
- **Good colors**: Easy to read, pleasant to look at
- **Smooth moves**: Nice animations when things change
- **Clear icons**: Pictures that make sense

### User-Friendly Features
- **Quick actions**: Common tasks are easy to find
